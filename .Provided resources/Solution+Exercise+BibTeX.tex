\section{Disney movies based on books}

Several of the Disney movies from our childhood is based on books. Examples are \textit{The Little Mermaid} which is based on \cite{andersen1964little}, \textit{The Hunchback of Notre-Dame} which is based on \cite{hugo2012hunchback}, and \textit{Treasure Planet} based on \cite{stevenson1883sea}. Common for most of these adaptations is that the original scripts is in the public domain. Hence one do not need to pay a licensing fee when creating an adaption. A more in-dept description on what it means that a work is in the public domain can be found here \cite{wiki:xxx}.

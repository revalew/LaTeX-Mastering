Examples are \textit{The Little Mermaid} which is based on [The Little Mermaid Book], \textit{The Hunchback of Notre-Dame} which is based on [Notre-Dame de Paris], and \textit{Treasure Planet} based on [The Sea Cook: A Story for Boys]. Common for most of these adaptations is that the original scripts is in the public domain. Hence one do not need to pay a licensing fee when creating an adaption. A more in-dept description on what it means that a work is in the public domain can be found here [Wikipedia].
